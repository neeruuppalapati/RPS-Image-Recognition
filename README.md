# RPS-Image-Recognition
This is a project that utilizes the opensource tensorflow library to create a machine learning model that is able to recognize what hand a person is throwing in the childrens game "Rock, Paper, Scissors".

The tensorflow library is one of 2 primary librarys used for machine learning, the other being pytorch. Both have their respective pros and cons, however pytorch is more suited for research while keras via tensorflow is much better for application, which is the scope of this project.

The goal of this project was to learn the basics of machine learning and understand the logic behind image recognition.
